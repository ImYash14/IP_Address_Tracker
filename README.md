The provided code implements a Splay Tree-based IP address tracker. Let's break down the key components of the code and discuss how the IP address tracker works.

1. Splay Tree Structure:
Node Structure (node):

Holds information about an IP address (ipAdd), data packet (dataPacket), and pointers to left, right, and parent nodes.
Splay Tree Structure (splay_tree):

Contains a pointer to the root of the Splay Tree.
2. Splay Tree Operations:
new_node:

Allocates memory for a new node and initializes its fields.
new_splay_tree:

Allocates memory for a new Splay Tree and initializes its root as NULL.
maximum:

Finds and returns the node with the maximum IP address in the given Splay Tree.
left_rotate and right_rotate:

Perform left and right rotations, respectively, on the Splay Tree to maintain its structure.
splay:

Performs splaying on the Splay Tree, bringing the accessed node to the root position.
insert:

Inserts a new node into the Splay Tree and performs splaying on the newly inserted node.
search:

Searches for a node with a specific IP address in the Splay Tree, performs splaying if found, and returns the node.
inorder:

Traverses the Splay Tree in inorder fashion and prints the IP addresses and corresponding data packets.
3. main Function:
Creates a Splay Tree (t) and initializes nodes (a to k) with specific IP addresses.

Inserts nodes into the Splay Tree.

Generates random data packets for the nodes with specific IP addresses and updates the corresponding nodes.

Prints the IP addresses and corresponding data packets using the inorder traversal.

4. Report on the IP Address Tracker Project:
Objective:

The project aims to implement an IP address tracker using a Splay Tree data structure to efficiently organize and search for IP addresses.
Key Features:

Dynamic Splay Tree structure for efficient insertion, search, and splaying operations.
Nodes store information about IP addresses and associated data packets.
Splaying is used to bring frequently accessed nodes closer to the root for faster future access.
Functionality:

Nodes are inserted into the Splay Tree based on their IP addresses.
Random data packets are generated for specific IP addresses, and the corresponding nodes are updated.
The final output displays IP addresses and their associated data packets.
Conclusion:

The IP address tracker project successfully utilizes a Splay Tree to organize and manage IP addresses, providing efficient search operations through splaying.
Improvements:

The project could be extended to include additional functionalities, such as deletion of nodes or more advanced IP address management features.
This report provides an overview of the structure, functionality, and potential improvements for the IP address tracker project implemented in the given code.
